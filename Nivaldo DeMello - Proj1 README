I believe I have questions 1-3 working so far.

1)	Updated join() with additional code. 
	Updated finish() with the call to join()
2)	Updated Condition2.java with code for interrupting without semaphores
3)	Updated Alarm.java to wait x amount of time
4)	Updated Communicator class
5)	Updated PriorityScheduler class

Modifications are untested.
